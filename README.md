# LearnOdys - Build Skills ,Break Limits

## Project Overview

This mini project focuses on developing a web-based Course Recommendation Platform that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents to deliver a personalized and adaptive learning experience.
The system begins with user authentication and profile setup, where learners specify their domain interests, existing skill sets, and learning objectives. Based on this information, users are redirected to a domain-specific dashboard where courses are filtered according to their individual requirements.
Using AI intelligence, the platform generates a structured and personalized learning roadmap. Within this roadmap, the system recommends relevant courses while also highlighting trending and industry-aligned options. Selected courses are added to a tracked learning list, enabling users to monitor progress over time.
Upon course or certification completion, the platform suggests domain-specific projects aligned with the learner’s acquired skills, helping bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical application. The AI agent continuously analyzes learning history to detect overlapping content and recommends adjustments to optimize the learning path.
To support knowledge retention and validation, the platform provides periodic quizzes and assessments. Users can also switch domains while preserving their learning history and progress. Each recommendation includes a brief explanation to ensure transparency, along with alerts for trending courses and relevant updates.                                                                                            
## Problem Statement

With the rapid expansion of online learning platforms, learners often struggle to select suitable courses, identify the correct learning sequence, and track long-term progress. Most existing platforms merely list courses without adapting to individual learner needs or validating learning decisions.
There is a clear need for an intelligent learning system that can guide users through personalized learning paths, dynamically adapt recommendations based on progress, and support the transition from learning to real-world application.

## Objectives

- To develop a web-based course recommendation platform
